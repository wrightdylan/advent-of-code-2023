## Notes
1. Binge watching Travellers wasn't helping me keep up with the Advent Calendar. If only it was chocolate :chocolate_bar:.
2. Day 3 part 1 was a bit of a struggle, but part 2 took literally seconds :laughing:.
3. Day 5 part 2 was 273s single threaded, but was 104s multithreaded. I was hoping for more performance.
